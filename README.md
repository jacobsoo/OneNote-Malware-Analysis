# OneNote-Malware-Analysis
This is just a random tool to aid you in analysing OneNote malware or phishing OneNote documents.

Ever since i read [this article](https://blog.sevagas.com/?RedTeam-With-OneNote), i've made a tool for it but I didn't get time to make this public.

Basically I am just using the dll from [Aspose](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/)

You can download the dll here.
